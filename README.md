## Introduction

It has always been hard to get tickets to student parties in Tampere Finland. I built the first version of this bot in Septempber 2020 to test my coding skills by building a PWA application that acts as a bot that reserves maximum amount of tickets for a given event. The app went viral which lead me to make part of its private.

This app works with kide.app and therefore requires your Kide.app credentials to work. Apart from that, only event url is needed. I'm planning to make this even more straightforward in the future. As it is a Progressive Web Application it means that you can run it on almost any device that has a browser.

## Usage

1. Head to **[KideAppBot.com](https://kideappbot.com)**
2. Sign in with your **[Kide.app](https://kide.app)** credentials
3. Copy event url from **[Kide.app](https://kide.app)**
   - Each event should start with <https://kide.app/events/>
4. Press **Start** button and watch the bot go ðŸ’¨

## Technical details

This is the third major version of the bot. It is a monorepo that uses PNPM workspaces and turborepo to manage the project. The project is made modular using PNPM workspaces which means that different parts of the application are split to their own reusable packages.

- Monorepo using [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) + [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference)
- Frontend: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) + [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/)

### Running locally

Note: If you only want to use the bot this section is not necessary!

1. Clone the repo and install with `pnpm install`
   - requires PNPM package manager
2. Run from root directory with `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> with browser
4. Follow the instructions in the **[usage](#usage)**

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute! I'm workign on open sourcing as much as possible and making the project in general maintainable and well documented.
