# Bot Logic

This package contains the logic for the bot.

Notice that you must set `IMPLEMENTATION_PAT` in `.env` file to make the `KideAppBot` class work properly.

See `src/bot/index.ts` for more information.

Alternatively you can import the `BotBase` class and extend it to create your own bot in your own package.
